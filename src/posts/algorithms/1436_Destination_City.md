# Overview
Question Source: [Destination City - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/)

# Dictionary: O(n) / O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths):
        dic = {}
        for city in paths:
            dic[city[0]] = city[1]
        # print(dic)
        cur_city = paths[0][0]
        while cur_city in dic:
            cur_city = dic[cur_city]
        return cur_city

s = Solution()
s.destCity([["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]) # A
s.destCity([["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]) # Sao Paulo
s.destCity([["A","Z"]]) # Z
```

# Two Sets: O(n) / O(n)
## Note
Note that this:
```py
depart = set(paths[i][0] for i in range(len(paths)))
arrive = set(paths[i][1] for i in range(len(paths)))
```
And this
```py
depart = set(path[0] for path in range(len(paths)))
arrive = set(path[1] for path in range(len(paths)))
```
Are the same. IMO the second one is more readable.

## Code
```py
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths):
        depart = set(path[0] for path in range(len(paths)))
        arrive = set(path[1] for path in range(len(paths)))
        return (arrive - depart).pop()
```

The below code is the same as above, but written in one line to be fancy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è:
```py
class Solution(object):
    def destCity(self, paths):
        return (set([path[1] for path in paths]) - set([path[0] for path in paths])).pop()
```
