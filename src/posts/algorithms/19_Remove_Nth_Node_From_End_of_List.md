```

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

```text
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:** Given n will always be valid.

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?
