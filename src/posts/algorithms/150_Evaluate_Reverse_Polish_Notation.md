```python

        operators = ["+","-","*","/"]
        stack = []

        for i in tokens:
            if i not in operators:
                stack.append(int(i))
            elif  i in operators:
                self._helper(stack, i)
        return stack[0]

    def _helper(self,stack, i):
        right = stack.pop()
        left = stack.pop()
        if i == "+":
            res = left + right
        elif i == "-":
            res = left - right
        elif i == "*":
            res = left * right
        elif i == "/":
            res = int(float(left)/float(right)) # int() makes sure to truncate towards zero. For some reason Leetcode needs float() added in order to work, otherwise the last test (22) fails.
        stack.append(res)
