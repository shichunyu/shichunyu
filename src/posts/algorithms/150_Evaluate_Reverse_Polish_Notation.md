title: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note:

Division between two integers should truncate toward zero. The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.

```text
Example 1:

Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

```text
Example 2:

Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

```text
Example 3:

Input: ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
  ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

## ✅ Using Stacks @shichunyu on May 7, 2020

```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        operators = ["+","-","*","/"]
        stack = []

        for i in tokens:
            if i not in operators:
                stack.append(int(i))
            elif  i in operators:
                self._helper(stack, i)
        return stack[0]

    def _helper(self,stack, i):
        right = stack.pop()
        left = stack.pop()
        if i == "+":
            res = left + right
        elif i == "-":
            res = left - right
        elif i == "*":
            res = left * right
        elif i == "/":
            res = int(float(left)/float(right)) # int() makes sure to truncate towards zero. For some reason Leetcode needs float() added in order to work, otherwise the last test (22) fails.
        stack.append(res)
